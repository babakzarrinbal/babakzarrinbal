Aboutme:
    I believe in self-learning teams and growing , and i've been part of wonderfull teams since now,
    I always tried to think out of the box and see the big picture, and encourage my coworker to do so,
    cause i belive main goal of every project will get lost eventually if we don't keep track of its targets.
    the thing that i love about myself is I'm fast and I have above normal IQ , i tend to work as 2 or 3 
    personel every where i've been and i developed strategies to keep myself aligned with the team so i don't
    break it's harmony,
    I like the opertunity to be challenged and get improved, and be part of something big.I have experinces
    in managemnet and project controll but I rather be part of the team then it's leader.

    In Summery I'm smart and a great teamworker.and I Learn what is needed by myself.
